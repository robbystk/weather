# Weather
A script to download, parse, and process weather forecast data 
from the National Weather Service. 
Reads a location file in the home directory or specified location
to request a point forecast for that location.  
Currently displays only what I call the integrated quantitative
precipitation forecast which is a prediction of how much rain or snow 
will fall over the next 24 hours.  

## ToDo
- Add more information
